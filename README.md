Generic Platform for Utilizing Processes

G.P.U.P (Java, JavaFX) – Generic Platform for Utilizing Processes –

The platform enables model set of dependencies between components and handles them efficiently.

• Insights: The platform enables extract various insights out of the ‘graph’ of components: routes, circles, transitive dependencies , etc.

• Execution: The platform enables running various tasks on the graph's nodes. It follows the Open-Close principle and can be extended with various tasks in the future. 
Tasks can be, for example: compilation task; testing task.
Execution is done in parallel to maximize the efficiency of processing.

• Distribution: The platform architecture enables distributed (remote) workers to connect to the server and execute work on their resources.
